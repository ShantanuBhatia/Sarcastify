# Sarcastify
## Because some texts is just silly.

Sarcastify is a Firefox extension for making Spongebob-style mockery of large chunks of text. Simply highlight the text in question, right click it and click the Sarcastify button to copy a MiXEd CAsE VErsioN tO yOUr ClipBoARd.

## Deployment

Clone the repo, open firebox and navigate to `about:debugging`. CLick on *This Firefox*, and then click on `Load Temporary add-on`. Navigate to the folder where the repo is cloned, and click any of the files.

This project is based off of the [MDN Webextensions Example For Context Menus](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/context-menu-copy-link-with-types) examples.
